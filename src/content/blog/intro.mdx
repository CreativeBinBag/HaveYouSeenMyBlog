There is an interesting English phrase "Know your onions". Onions also happen to be political in my country. From that line of reasoning, onions and opinions should be interchangeable. That is one of my onions!

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <Polaroid
    src="/onion-dark.png"
    alt="Dark Mode Onion"
    caption="Onion"
    rotate="2"
  />
  <Polaroid
    src="/onion-light.png"
    alt="Light Mode Onion"
    caption="Onion again, but with a lot of panache"
    rotate="-1"
  />
</div>
