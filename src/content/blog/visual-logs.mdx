I've updated the site engine to handle rich media.

## Polaroid

I wanted images to feel like they were physically taped to this digital graph paper.

<Polaroid
  src="/avatar.jpg"
  alt="My pixel avatar"
  caption="Fig 1. Self-Portrait in 8-bit."
  rotate="-2"
/>

You can stack them or rotate them differently to create a messy desk vibe.

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <Polaroid
    src="/onion-dark.png"
    alt="Dark Mode Onion"
    caption="The Dark Onion"
    rotate="2"
  />
  <Polaroid
    src="/onion-light.png"
    alt="Light Mode Onion"
    caption="The Light Onion"
    rotate="-1"
  />
</div>

For moving pictures, I didn't want a standard YouTube embed. It needed to feel like a CRT monitor feed.

<RetroVideo
  src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
  caption="Sample Footage: Nature Simulation v1.0"
/>
