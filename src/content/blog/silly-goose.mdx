I built a portfolio back in July that runs entirely in the browser. Idk I just felt like doing it.

## Output

You can actually play it right here within the blog (but it only runs on a 'puter):

<GameBoyEmbed

  title="Silly Goose RPG"
/>

## How it works

The movement logic is grid-based. Here is a snippet of the collision detection:

```javascript
function checkCollision(x, y) {
  if (map[y][x] === 1) {
    return true; // Wall hit!
  }
  return false;
}
```
